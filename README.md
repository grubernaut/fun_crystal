Side project to help me in learning crystal

###Project 1 - Factorial
Take a single argument into compiled binary, compute the factorial recursively and iteratively, printing the output of both.

Compile:

```
crystal build ./factorial.cr
```

Run:

```
./factorial 10
Recursive -> 10! = 3628800
Iterative -> 10! = 3628800
```
